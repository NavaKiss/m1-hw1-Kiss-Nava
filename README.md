## About Me
Hi! My name is Nava and I'm a photographer, social media manager, and outdoor enthusiast currently living in southern California. I spent the last 7 years in Florida, where I completed undergrad at UF and then worked in Pensacola for 3 years. When I'm not behind a camera or at work, I'm typically outside pursuing one of my many hobbies: camping, backpacking, SCUBA diving, horseback riding, running, and attempting to surf. I currently work for the Marine Corps at a social media manager, photographer, and videographer, but I do media and digital strategy as a freelancer as well. I love my work and it keeps me very busy!
## Past Coding Experience
Literally none! I was the web manager of a National Park and have my own website to display my photography services and portfolio but both of those sites use Content Management Systems so I never had to do any coding. Excited to learn more so I can customize my site!
## Career Goals
1. Complete my Master's by summer 2026
2. Learn enough code to customize my photography website
3. Maintain my current role and grow my company's social media following
4. Expand my videography portfolio to include commercial projects
